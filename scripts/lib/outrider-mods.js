/**
 * Outrider's Mods: shared folder helper for every Outrider Foundry VTT module.
 *
 * COPY THIS FILE VERBATIM into each module (scripts/lib/outrider-mods.js). The folder ids,
 * root name and color must be identical everywhere so every installed Outrider module finds
 * and reuses the same "Outrider's Mods" folder in each sidebar tab, whichever runs first.
 *
 * Layout is FLAT: packs and world documents go directly into "Outrider's Mods", no per-module
 * subfolder (each pack already shows its module as a subtitle). Per-module folders from older
 * versions are emptied into the root and deleted once empty.
 *
 * Rules (see HANDOFF-OutriderMods-branding.md):
 * - Only move things that are top-level or in this module's own folder; anything the GM put
 *   in some other folder is left alone.
 * - Only delete a module folder this module owns, and only when it is empty.
 * - Requires Foundry v11+ (Compendium folders). Check `supported()` before syncing.
